<h2>What is lean</h2>
<h3>TL;DR: Some cold hard facts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>lean is a micro lib written in PHP5.3.</li>
    <li>lean has everything you need to build a full fledged website, not more.</li>
    <li>lean is more of a library or toolkit than a framework.</li>
    <li>lean has an application class, utilizing <a href="http://slimframework.com">Slim</a>'s routing and dispatching.
    </li>
    <li>It's lightweight, it's fun, it's lean!</li>
</ul>
<h3>In depth</h3>
<p>
    lean is a small and lightweight library in PHP 5.3 and should be included in every project! It gives you easy and
    small components for templating, I18N, etc. along with some powerful utility classes such as <em>lean\Dump</em> and
    <em>lean\Text</em>.
</p>
<p>
    On top of that, it brings /:controller/:action functionality to the <a href="http://slimframework.com">Slim</a>
    micro framework, complete with layout and partials!
</p>
<p>
    What we mean by "lean gives you freedom" is that it does not put a frame around your code that limits your
    possibilities and forces you to do things in a certain way. We believe in the power of the programmer
    and in their abilities to come up with good solutions for their problems, equipped with our library.
</p>
<p>
    lean is a good foundation to build upon but enough with the chitchat, here's a feature complete feature list!

            <p>
                This woman had to deal with monolithic frameworks!<br/>
                She should've used lean instead and saved herself a good deal of trouble!
